# ConferenceScheduling
You are planning a big programming conference and have received many proposals which have passed the initial screen process but you're having trouble fitting them into the time constraints of the day -- there are so many possibilities! So you write a program to do it for you.
<br />The conference has multiple tracks each of which has a morning and afternoon session.
<br />Each session contains multiple talks.
<br />Morning sessions begin at 9am and must finish by 12 noon, for lunch.
<br />Afternoon sessions begin at 1pm and must finish in time for the networking event.
<br />The networking event can start no earlier than 4:00 and no later than 5:00.
<br />No talk title has numbers in it.
<br />All talk lengths are either in minutes (not hours) or lightning (5 minutes).
<br />Presenters will be very punctual; there needs to be no gap between sessions.
<br /> 
<br />Note that depending on how you choose to complete this problem, your solution may give a different ordering or combination of talks into tracks. This is acceptable; you donâ€™t need to exactly duplicate the sample output given here.

<br />Code Structure
<br />
<br />ConferencePlanner - Main class to run the project
<br />Talk - This class stores all attributes of a Talk
<br />Session - Session is composition of Talks 
<br />Track - Track is composition of Sessions
<br />Conference  - Conference is composition of Tracks
<br />TalkException - Talk related exceptions
<br />ScheduleException - Schedule Related exceptions
<br />InputFileParser - To parse the input file and create Talk list
<br />Constants - This class will have the contants used in the package. It will also store all error or other messages displayed to the user.
<br />ConferenceScheduler - Scheduler for the conference. 
<br />Util - used for utility functions
<br />SessionSlot - Enum defines the slot for the talk
<br />
<br />test package
<br />TestInputParser - junit test cases for testing the file parser
<br />TestConferenceScheduler - junit test cases for scheduling related functionality
<br />
<br />Assumptions :
<br />1. Task greater than 240 mins cannot be scheduled.
<br />2. Networking Event is 60 mins though it has no impact on the output.
